## About Us

**Our Mission**

As a company, our mission is to provide affordable, and lightweight software solutions to companies around the globe. This is because during our time in the software industry we have noticed a lack in affordable and modern software.

**Skills**

We are a team of very skilled developers, meaning we have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more languages. We prefer working in JavaScript for our back-end work as it has hundreds of frameworks that we are able to work with to make the best possible and most secure back-ends.

**Our Story**

We don't really want to bore you with all the nitty gritty details. However, we will give you a quick summary of our story and our goals.

In May 2022 this company was founded by Olli Patrick Wesselingh, it was originally a bit of a joke just so he could say that he owned a company. Little did he know, it would become so much more.

Over a few years of experience with software in the game and web hosting industry, Olli realised there really wasn't enough up-to-date and actually good software for this industry despite it being a massive industry. In response to this shortage of good software, he decided to make some of his own, starting with the creation of Eryx, a VPS management panel. With this panel came a lot of new ideas and goals for this company.

One of these goals is to continue development and improving the hosting industry's software so that all companies can have a chance at creating great services for people. However, we believe that something great about life and the future is that it's unpredictable. You never know what may happen. So, with that being said, what we may do in the future could be literally anything, but we can tell you one thing for sure. We will put our hearts into it to ensure it will be great.

Thank you for reading our story and aspirations<br>
Best regards, <br>
Olli Patrick Wesselingh
